# Hackathon


we should add the task here....  


main code algorythm:
> from the articles files (txt/html) that we have  
> the program will find all with the list of predefined 'suspicious' words like 'conflict','violation','problem','jews', etc (I'm trying to use compromising words and not too strict)  
> based upon these words found we will create a list of files for more precize check like suspicious files (manually and also programmly)  
>   program method: one more set of detailed phrazes like if/else ('not pro-israeli', etc.)  
>   manual method: suggest us to read files ourselves and decided to put them into database or not  
> if the files considered 'not ok' we put them into our database (the urls from github) along with bad phrazes that we found.  
> In our resources database we have like pairs 'speical bad words' = resource1 , 'other bad words' = resource2  
> resources1,2,3,etc are just links to pro-israeli contents like e.g. laws, organizations, etc.  
> We compare one database to another to provide a list of appropriate resources, it's easy like if one db bad words = another db bad words,  
> then we provide another db defined resources (like from the same row in the db table)
> That's the task
